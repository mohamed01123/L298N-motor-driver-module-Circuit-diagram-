📁 L298N Motor Driver Module – Custom Circuit Design
📌 Overview
This project involves designing a custom motor driver circuit based on the L298N dual H-Bridge IC. The goal is to control two DC motors through a microcontroller with added protection and regulated power supply. The circuit supports external power input and can safely interface with most microcontrollers (e.g., ATmega32, Arduino, STM32).

⚙️ Circuit Description

 🔌 Power Supply Section
A 3-pin screw terminal is used to connect:
GND
+5V (Logic supply) – Can come from the microcontroller or regulated 5V from 7805
VCC (Motor supply) – Power input for the motors, typically 6V to 12V
The 7805 voltage regulator steps down motor power (VCC) to a clean 5V for logic use.
A 2-pin jumper socket is used to optionally connect the 5V from the 7805 to the logic supply, allowing shared or isolated supplies.


🚦 Indicator LED
An LED with a current-limiting resistor is connected across the regulated 5V and GND to indicate power status.


🧠 L298N Control Logic
The L298N IC takes six control inputs:
ENA – Enable Motor A
IN1, IN2 – Direction control for Motor A
IN3, IN4 – Direction control for Motor B
ENB – Enable Motor B
A 6-pin female header socket is used to connect these control lines to a microcontroller.


🔄 Motor Connections
Two 2-pin screw terminals are used to connect Motor A and Motor B to the output of the L298N.


🛡️ Protection Diodes
8 diodes are placed across the motor output pins (OUT1–OUT4) and power supply lines to safeguard the L298N IC from inductive spikes and magnetic back-EMF generated by the motors.
🔗 Microcontroller Interface
Pin on Socket	        Function
ENA                 	Enable Motor A (PWM capable pin)
IN1	                  Motor A Direction 1
IN2                  	Motor A Direction 2
IN3                 	Motor B Direction 1
IN4                 	Motor B Direction 2
ENB	                  Enable Motor B (PWM capable pin)
Use the ENA/ENB pins with PWM output from your microcontroller to control motor speed.


📝 Notes
Keep heatsink on L298  if using motors with higher current demand.
Always check the power rating of your motors and match the VCC input accordingly.
When using only one power supply, close the jumper to connect 5V logic with the output from 7805.
If using separate supplies for logic and motors, keep the jumper open and make sure both share a common ground.
